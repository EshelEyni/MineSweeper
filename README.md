## Installation

```bash

```

After cloning the repository, move into the project directory:

This project uses Parcel for bundling the application. You can start the development server using:

```bash
npm run start
```

And build the application for production with:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run your test suite using:

```bash
npm run test
```

The application should be running at `http://localhost:1234` if you're running the development server.

## Usage

Open the application in a web browser. You can select the difficulty level, place flags to mark potential mines, use hints or safe clicks, or undo previous moves. A timer keeps track of the game duration. The game ends when all non-mine cells are revealed, or a mine is clicked.
